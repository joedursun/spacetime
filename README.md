# About

This repo contains an in-progress whitepaper discussing the link between
quantum mechanics and black hole singularities. The paper is encrypted while
I in rough draft form but will be made publicly available once ready for review.

The purpose of encrypting it is so that I have a publicly recorded timeline of
progress that can be verified by the community while allowing for privacy
until it's ready for review.

# Decryption

Edit `./decrypt.sh` with the location of the `secret.key` file and then run.
Eventually I'll upload the decrypted whitepaper and possibly check in the
decryption key so the history can be verified.
